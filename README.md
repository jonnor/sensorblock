A Sensorblock is a small, generic device for sensing the physical world.
It allows you to very quickly experiment with physical computing.

A Sensorblock contains a range of normal sensors, a microcontroller, wireless communication,
persistent storage and a battery. You can program it to work independently, to collaborate
with other Sensorblocks or with a standard computer.

You can attach a Sensorblock to the wall or ceiling with double-sided tape,
keep them in your pocket or backpack, leave it outside in the rain.

Milestones
===========
* 0.0.1: Proof-of-concept. Prototype with 4 sensors, case, battery and wireless demonstrated.
* 0.1.0: Minimally useful. A Sensorblock has been used in a production system, plans allow others to reproduce.
* x.0.0: One can purchase ready-made Sensorblocks from several manufacturers, or make ones own using standard fablab equipment.

TODO
=====
